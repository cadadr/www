Sources for Göktuğ's Website
============================

This repository contains the static website setup for [my website][ws].
The sources for the pages live in a separate, private repository because
it includes unpublished drafts.

What you see is a simple static website built using [Hakyll], trying
to use as minimal styling as possible to give it some identity without
departing too much from an [essential web look][mofo].  Sticking to good
simple HTML and minimal styling, and avoiding unnecessary interaction
ensures that the pages are accessible to the differently abled and to
people lacking decent [internet access][netspds], that they [respect
readers' decisions][cascade], eat up less resources, and maintain a nice,
sustainable [BMI][webobesity] level.
